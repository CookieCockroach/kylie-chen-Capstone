# Project Title

## Overview

A closet management app that allows users to organize their clothes in a way that makes it easy to check what they have and get inspirations on what to wear.

### Problem

- Closet management is a pain for people who have a lot of clothes.
- It is hard to find inspiration for what to wear based on what you have.

### Features
- a database to store clothes details/descriptions ("my closet")
  - a library to store clothes icons/images; or a ready to use API
  - in terms of images, pre-define some clothes 'prototypes' and assign to items based on the category user chooses?
  - find little icons of t-shirts, pants, dresses, etc. i need to control the amount of prototypes to bigger categories?
- a way to get inspiration for what to wear
  - find a fashion API to get outfit specific photos
  - pull a pair of keywords from closet and get inspiration from the fashion API (randomized pair)
- a laudry basket to show checked-out clothes
  - a button attached to each item to check it out to laundry basket
  - shopping-cart to collect & restore all laundry basket items 
  - another seperate database to store laundry basket items?
